# Starship-Mars-Landing
“Python simulation of a Starship Mars landing with restricted access”


New values ​​have been entered that require refueling at an altitude of 500 km after launch. Otherwise, the rocket would have to be at least one-third larger than it is currently built to travel from Earth to Mars and into orbit.

I'm taking into account that refueling will take place at an altitude of 200 km after launch on Mars. 


I will stick with this problem
